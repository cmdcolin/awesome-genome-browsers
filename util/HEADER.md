# awesome-genome-visualization

A list of interesting genome visualizers, genome browsers, or
genome-browser-like implementations

See the new companion website here
https://cmdcolin.github.io/awesome-genome-visualization/

Follow the Twitter account here too :) https://twitter.com/awesomegenomev1

Note that the organization on the GitHub README here is a best effort
categorization using the first tag applied to each tool, but tools can have
multiple tags too. See the website to see all tags applied to tools

Note: This list runs the gammut from bespoke and simple to more general-purpose
and complex tools. Some are historical, or may be for more visual inspiration
only

I also encourage you to make your own visualization, things like R make this so
much easier! But also consider making your visualization code re-usable for the
wider community! And feel free to send PRs for more tools!
